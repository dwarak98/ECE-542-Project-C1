Motivation
============

Weather stress and climate change are major challenges for agriculture. Drought tolerant soybean varieties are needed but breeding for drought tolerance in soybean, is difficult. Soybean breeders evaluate thousands of field plots annually in order to select the best plants to advance for further testing or to release as a new variety. The most widely used indicator of drought tolerance/sensitivity in soybean is leaf wilting during periods of water stress1, and breeders collect this data in the most low-tech way imaginable â€” walking the field with a notebook and writing down ratings to indicate how wilted each field plot looks.
